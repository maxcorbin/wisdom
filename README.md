# Begin Here

Try to keep in mind that everyone is going learn their own way. The tech world is constantly changing with a rapid pace, so the way I learned things is not necessarily going to be the way that someone exactly like me is going to learn things, just because we started at different times when different technologies were mature.

Also, we're different people! So some of the things that I'll talk about won't resonate with you and that's okay. Wherever possible, I'll try to include alternative sources for you to explore on your own. These can be supplemental to the stuff I'll cover, or they can send you off into a whole new direction that I don't know enough about.

With that, let's start with the landscape. I'm going to try to use analogies to cars right now but just remember that the analogy isn't perfect.

## Software

Most of the time you're probably thinking of "software" when you think about what a programmer does all day. But that's actually only part of what is going on in tech. It's what makes money for investors and what most people think they want to do when they're coming out of school with a Computer Science degree.

> I would define software as an end product, designed to be used/consumed by someone with only minimal understanding of what the software's source code is doing, and perhaps maintained or deployed by someone with slightly more advanced understanding.

Let's think of a car by analogy. When I buy a car (or borrow one from a friend) I get an interface that allows me to use the car without understanding how it works: the wheel, the pedals, the dashboard, etc. This makes me a user.

The person who designed the car from the ground up is a *software engineer*, maybe inspired by other cars. You will sometimes see software engineer shortened to SWE.

## Operations

A lot of tech work doesn't actually produce code or executables that anyone else will ever use. Sometimes you just need someone to keep things running, fix problems that come up, and maybe have some general working knowledge to prototype solutions to problems that come up with the cars.

If I'm a mechanic, I might get a car for my own use, but maintain it myself. I know enough about it to take it apart and put it back together in some limited ways, and maybe I can customize it by swapping parts out or even removing parts that I don't think are necessary or desirable. If it breaks or there's a serious problem in the design, I might be able to come up with a stopgap solution that works pretty well, and maybe I'll tell the engineers about my solution in case they want to adopt it as a permanent feature of their future cars.

I might even work in the shop sometimes doing assembly of cars that other people have designed, according to their blueprints.

The person who assembles and maintains the cars, modifies them for specific purposes, and fixes them when they break are *dev ops engineers*. Dev ops stands for "development operations", and it encompasses a ton of work that is absolutely necessary for a website or a web application to function, but is a lot less glamorous than the work that software engineers do.

## Security

There is some overlap here between operations and security, but I generally think of them as being separate because security requires a much higher degree of skill and it's usually a different team of people than the dev ops team, for many reasons.
